# credit-card

## What The Program Does?
Takes in user input for a credit card number. The program will tell weather\
it's a MASTERCARD, VISA, or AMEX. The program will also tell if it's an invalid CC card.

Note: The libraries used are specific for cs50, so in order to run this program quivalent\
libraries may have to be imported.

## Background
I spent a couple weeks going through an online site course called cs50 that was a free computer\
science class. This was one of the projects that they had for people to work on.
